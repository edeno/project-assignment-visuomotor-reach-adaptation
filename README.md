# Project Assignment: Visuomotor Reach Adaptation

As a teaching assistant for the class [CN540 - Neural and Computational Models of Adaptive Movement Planning and Control](http://cns-web.bu.edu/courses/courses.html#540), I created a final project assignment and a computational model inspired by Bullock et al. (1993) and Grosse-Wentrup and Vidal (2007).

The project challenges the student to understand how the brain learns to perform visually-guided reaches by integrating both motor and visual sensory feedback. In order to complete the assignment, the student must show understanding of the model by adding additional features to the model and by critiquing the added features.

This repository provides the [assignment](/CN540 Final Project.pdf) and [related code](src/cn540_striatum_model.m).
